# Virtualenv Bootstrap Django

The best way to have people contributing to your project is to make easy for them to just **checkout** and **run**.

Virtualenv Bootstrap helps your contributor to just clone your repository and setup a django development environment with just one command:

1.  Clone the repository:

        git clone [your repo]


2.  Bootstrap the development environment:

        python bootstrap

It works based on built-in [Virtualenv][] capabilities, but it's completely isolated. Perfect even for newcommers who don't still have or understand Python Packaging tools.

## How it works?

Virtualenv Bootstrap detects your current python interpreter and:

1. Creates a [Virtualenv][] for your project;
2. Installs [Distribute][];
3. Setups a simple [postactivate][] file for those who use [Virtualenvwrapper][];
4. Searches for your [requirements.txt][] at your repository root and install all your dependencies with [Pip][];


## How to add it to your project?

Just copy the `bootstrap` directory to you repository directory.

You can easely do this with the following script:

    curl -L https://github.com/henriquebastos/virtualenv-bootstrap/tarball/master | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 */bootstrap


## How to extend it?

You might want to automate some other tasks to make the setup of complex projects really easy, like:

- runing tests
- detecting presence of services your project needs
- etc.

For that, just add your own commands to the function `after_install` on your `bootstrap/hook.py`.
